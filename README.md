# book-search-engine
I was tasked with taking a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactoring it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was initially built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
